The park in the north is located between two main school buildings which can accommodate 600 pupils and a massive sports field. The car park and the main entrance to the school are located in the western part of the site.

Although most of the geographical features remain unchanged in the second diagram, the school has undergone a number of changes. The connection between both school buildings have been has been set up via an indoor passage. A third school building has been constructed, which can accommodate 400 more pupils. The sports field has been reduced in size and relocated near the second car park, which is now connected with the main road. 

Overall, major changes have been implemented at the school site to increase its capacity. The relocation of a sports field gave room for the construction of a third school building and a second car park.
