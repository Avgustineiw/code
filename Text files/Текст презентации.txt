//Introduction

For more than a thousand years of history, Russia has faced many trials. There have been wars, and internal upheavals, natural disasters and economic difficulties. The hardest
test and the greatest victory was the victory in the Great Patriotic War. Its magnitude
eclipses all previous trials and victories, even the Patriotic War of 1812. Today, every citizen of Russia is aware about the great feat of our ancestors. Any war is a heavy test for the country and the people. 
If the merits of great military figures are clearly visible to contemporaries and historians, then the heroism of ordinary soldiers is not so obvious. However, their contribution to victory is often more important than the genius of commanders. We will tell you about the feats of ordinary soldiers from literature and history who showed great bravery, courage and valour during the war.

//Devyataev

The first example to describe a portrait of a hero will be Russian pilot Mikhail Petrovich Devyatayev. His feat is a remarkable story of true courage and resilience during World War II. The story took place in 1944 when he was serving as a navigator in the Soviet Air Force.

Devyatayev was part of a bomber crew that was conducting a mission over German-occupied territory when he was shot down by the German Luftwaffe. He and his crew survived but were captured and sent to a Nazi concentration camp near Berlin.

While in captivity, Devyatayev began plotting an escape plan. He managed to gather a group of Soviet prisoners, and on February 8, 1945, during a transport operation, Devyatayev and his comrades seized control of a German Heinkel He 111 bomber that was scheduled for testing by the Nazis. Despite lacking proper training in piloting such an aircraft, Devyatayev managed to fly the plane to Soviet-controlled territory.

Devyatayev and his companions faced the risk of being shot down by both German and soviet anti-aircraft fire or being intercepted by Luftwaffe fighters. However, he successfully navigated through enemy territory and landed the plane in Soviet-controlled territory, where the crew was greeted as heroes.

Devyatayev's escape not only saved his own life and lives of his comrades but also provided important information to the Soviet forces about the inner workings of the concentration camp. Moreover, he managed to capture invaluable intelligence about the German V-2 missile program, including blueprints and the exact coordinates of the rocket weapons production plants and the V-2 launch sites. Devyatayev's extraordinary leadership and determination earned him numerous awards and honors, including the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.

After the war, Devyatayev continued to serve in the Soviet Air Force and later became a test pilot. The story of his great escape remains a testament to the human spirit and the bravery of those who fought against Nazies during World War II.


//Literature example: "The dawns here are quiet..."

I'd like to continue our characteristic of a hero with an example from the russian literature. I'll tell you about drama and tragedy of women who became soldiers during the war. 

I first encountered this topic while reading a novel "The dawns here are quiet..." by B. Vasilyev.
It tells us a story about starshina Vaskov who receives a squad of young artillery girls. 

One of them, Rita Osyanina, has lost her husband on the second day of the war. That tragedy made Rita send her son Albert to her parents and volunteer to an military school. With the death of her husband, she learned to hate Germans "quietly and mercilessly" and was harsh with the other girls.

The exact opposite of that is Jenya Komelkova, who volunteered to the frontier after the Germans shot her loved ones. Nevertheless, Jenya is "outgoing and mischievous".

The third member of the squad is Liza Brichkina, who sacrificed 5 years of her life looking after her mother. Because of that she didn't finish school and couldn't apply for higher education. Unfortunately for her, the war started and even the slightest chance of getting a degree has vanished. 

The last two members, Sonya Gurvich and Galya Chetvertak, led a peaceful life until the beginning of the war, and felt it was their duty to defend the motherland. 

One morning, Rita notices a two german soldiers passing around their camp, and tells starshina Vaskov about it. He commands to follow them, and decides to take a shortcut and prepare an ambush. Turns out, that Rita was wrong and there were 16 soldiers, so Vaskov send Liza Brichkina back to report on the change of situation. But Liza, crossing the swamp, stumbles and drowns. 

After that the story shifts back to Vaskov's group when Sonya Gurvich volunteers to fetch Vaskov's lost bag, but encounters german soldiers who kill her. Without his weapon, Vaskov is unable to fight back the germans, so he tries to save the remaining members, but during an unfair fight, the germans kill everyone except Vaskov, who managed to stay alive. 

Since he has nothing to lose now, he buries the bodies of the girls and runs to the hut where the remaining enemies are. He kills one of them on the spot while the rest tie each other with belts, as they do not believe that Vaskov could be "alone for many miles". He loses consciousness from pain only when the Russians are coming towards him.

After many years starshina with grey hair and a captain Albert visit that place again to pay tribute to everyone who fell during the war.

I was personally moved by that novel, because it shows the courage and strength of women during the war. Even in the face of death they are not stopped by the enemy and show great courage and bravery. But Boris Vasilyev concludes that women suffer more horrors of the war than men. That's why war doesn't have a woman's face.

//Zoya

When we talk about heroes in Russian stories and history, we often think of people who are not just brave in battle but also show great courage in difficult times. World War II was a time when many such heroes emerged. One of the most famous heroes during this time was Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya.

Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya was only 18 years old when she became known for her bravery. She was part of the Komsomol, which was a youth organization in the Soviet Union. Zoya decided to join a dangerous mission behind enemy lines to stop the German army from advancing towards Moscow. She did brave things to slow down the enemy, but she was eventually caught. Even though she was tortured, she didn't give any information about her team or their plans. She was executed in a village, but before she died, she stayed strong and spoke about her belief in her country's victory over the enemy.

After her death, stories about Zoya's bravery were shared everywhere by the Soviet media. She was honored as a Hero of the Soviet Union after she died. Her story inspired books, movies, and songs, making her an important symbol of courage and strength. Zoya's story is a reminder of the kind of moral strength and the willingness to sacrifice oneself for the greater good that Russian heroes are known for.

Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya's story is a powerful example of what it means to be a hero in Russia. It shows the value of giving up one's own safety for others, standing strong against impossible challenges, and fighting for what is right. Her story is part of a larger tradition in Russia that celebrates heroism not just in battles but in standing up for justice and good, even in the toughest times.

//conclusion

I want to start the conclusion of our project with few sentences from the book to show the connection. 

Heroism is not only a sacrifice in a moment of mortal peril, but also a fulfilment of the duty, faithfulness of oath to the community and their neighbors.
A deadly danger can meet the hero at a critical moment, or it can wait for him for a long time. (book, chapter 1 & 1.3)

Examples from our project can easily complement these statements. A squad of young girls and Vaskov from the “The dawns here are quiet..” were courageous even in the moments of death. They contributed to the homeland till the end.
Zoya’s story is indeed a powerful example of heroism and selflessness. Her courage in the face of danger and her unwavering commitment to her cause have made her a symbol of bravery and inspiration in Russian history. Her willingness to sacrifice herself for the greater good embodies the values of honor, patriotism, and resilience that are highly esteemed in Russian culture. 

So, in times of war, the philosophy of the feat emerges as a powerful guiding principle that transcends fear and adversity. It emphasizes the importance of honor, sacrifice, and resilience in the face of danger. As we reflect on the stories of those who have shown exceptional bravery in war, we are reminded of the enduring power of the human spirit to overcome challenges and stand up for what is right, even in the most difficult of circumstances.
