//Introduction

For more than a thousand years of history, Russia has faced many trials. There have been wars,
and internal upheavals, natural disasters and economic difficulties. The hardest
test and the greatest victory was the victory in the Great Patriotic War. Its magnitude
eclipses all previous trials and victories, even the Patriotic War of 1812. Today, every citizen of Russia remembers about it. Any war is a heavy test for the country and the people. 
If the merits of great military figures are clearly visible to contemporaries and historians, then the heroism of ordinary soldiers is not so obvious. However, their contribution to victory is often more important than the genius of commanders. We will tell you about the feats of ordinary soldiers who showed great courage during the war.

//Zoya

When we talk about heroes in Russian stories and history, we often think of people who are not just brave in battle but also show great courage in difficult times. World War II was a time when many such heroes emerged. One of the most famous heroes during this time was Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya.

Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya was only 18 years old when she became known for her bravery. She was part of the Komsomol, which was a youth organization in the Soviet Union. Zoya decided to join a dangerous mission behind enemy lines to stop the German army from advancing towards Moscow. She did brave things to slow down the enemy, but she was eventually caught. Even though she was tortured, she didn't give any information about her team or their plans. She was executed in a village, but before she died, she stayed strong and spoke about her belief in her country's victory over the enemy.

After her death, stories about Zoya's bravery were shared everywhere by the Soviet media. She was honored as a Hero of the Soviet Union after she died. Her story inspired books, movies, and songs, making her an important symbol of courage and strength. Zoya's story is a reminder of the kind of moral strength and the willingness to sacrifice oneself for the greater good that Russian heroes are known for.

Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya's story is a powerful example of what it means to be a hero in Russia. It shows the value of giving up one's own safety for others, standing strong against impossible challenges, and fighting for what is right. Her story is part of a larger tradition in Russia that celebrates heroism not just in battles but in standing up for justice and good, even in the toughest times.


//Literature example: "The dawns here are quiet..."

So far we've talked about different feats of russian people during the Great Patriotic war. I'd like to continue our characteristic of a hero with an example from the russian literature. It is about drama and tragedy of women who became soldiers during the war. 

I first encountered this topic while reading a novel "The dawns here are quiet..." by B. Vasilyev.
It tells us a story about starshina Vaskov who receives a squad of young artillery girls.
