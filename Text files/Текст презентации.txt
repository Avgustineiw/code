//Introduction

For more than a thousand years of history, Russia has faced many trials. There have been wars,
and internal upheavals, natural disasters and economic difficulties. The hardest
test and the greatest victory was the victory in the Great Patriotic War. Its magnitude
eclipses all previous trials and victories, even the Patriotic War of 1812. Today, every citizen of Russia remembers about it. Any war is a heavy test for the country and the people. We will tell about the heroism of both the personalities who went down in history, and the feats of ordinary soldiers.
If the merits of great military figures are clearly visible to contemporaries and historians, then the heroism of ordinary soldiers is not so obvious. However, their contribution to victory is often more important than the genius of commanders.

//Literature example: "The dawns here are quiet..."

So far we've talked about different feats of russian people during the Great Patriotic war. I'd like to continue our characteristic with an example from the russian literature about drama and tragedy of a woman who became a soldier during the war. 

I first encountered this topic while reading a novel "The dawns here are quiet..." by B. Vasilyev.
