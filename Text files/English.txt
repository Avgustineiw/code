David Asch in his TED talk presents several physological ideas. For instance, one of the ideas was that losses loom larger than gains. We agree with the statement, as people on a physocological level consider losses to be more traumatic, thus, they try to avoid them. That's why people are more motivated to do something when they fear that their inaction can lead to negative consequences.

Another idea was that humans try doing their best in circumstances when they are watched after. We also agree with that, because our upbringing and school years made us fear what other people think about us. In return, people are more likely to do things that are "socially correct", seeking society approval.
